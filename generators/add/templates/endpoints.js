// Use this to define model-specific interactions with the API
// and reduce the workload on the actions. This technique probably
// isn't very necessary if you're not doing a lot of AJAX work,
// but is useful once you start defining more models.
//
// We recommend using `fetch` (either with the `isomorphic-fetch` or
// `whatwg-fetch` modules) for its easy mocking using the `fetch-mock` module.
